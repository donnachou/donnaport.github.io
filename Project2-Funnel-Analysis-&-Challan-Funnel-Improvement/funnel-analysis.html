    <h2>Funnel Analysis & Drop-off Reduction – Cars24 Internship Project</h2>

    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> High drop-off rates in the Challan payment flow on the Orbit platform were affecting conversion rates and causing user frustration.</p>

    <p><strong>Approach:</strong> I performed an in-depth funnel analysis to identify the key points where users were dropping off. This involved reviewing data and feedback to uncover usability issues in the payment flow. Based on this analysis, I collaborated with the design team to implement UI/UX changes that would optimize the flow and reduce friction.</p>

    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> After implementing the changes, we saw a reduction in drop-offs by 15%–75% depending on the user segment. The optimized flow also improved overall user satisfaction and conversions.</p>

    <p><strong>Skills Used:</strong> Data Analysis, User Testing, UI/UX Optimization, Collaboration with Design Team</p>
