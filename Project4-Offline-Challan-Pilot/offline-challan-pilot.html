    <h2>Offline Challan Pilot – Cars24 Internship Project</h2>

    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Users were facing difficulties paying traffic challans online due to slow processing times, leading to high drop-offs in the payment flow.</p>

    <p><strong>Approach:</strong> I managed the design and implementation of an offline challan payment flow pilot, where users could pay their fines offline through partner stores. I worked on user research, feature development, and testing to improve the overall user experience during the payment process.</p>

    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> The pilot resulted in a 25% reduction in drop-off rates, with an 80% increase in successful payments during the trial period. It also paved the way for a full-scale offline payment solution.</p>

    <p><strong>Skills Used:</strong> Product Design, User Research, Flow Optimization, Payment Integration</p>
