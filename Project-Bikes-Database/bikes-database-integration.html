    <h2>Bike Database Integration – Cars24 Internship Project</h2>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> The search functionality for bikes on Cars24 was inaccurate, resulting in poor user experience and increased drop-offs during searches.</p>

    <p><strong>Approach:</strong> I integrated a database of over 10,000 bikes into the Orbit platform to enhance the search functionality. This involved cleaning and organizing the data, ensuring accuracy, and optimizing filtering capabilities.</p>

    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> The accuracy of the search improved significantly, leading to a decrease in drop-off rates and an increase in user engagement. This resulted in better conversions and overall user satisfaction.</p>

    <p><strong>Skills Used:</strong> MySQL, Data Integration, Collaboration with Development Team</p>
