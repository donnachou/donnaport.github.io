    <h2>Challan Grievances Resolution – Cars24 Internship Project</h2>

    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Customers were facing issues with challan discrepancies, resulting in negative feedback and a poor user experience.</p>

    <p><strong>Approach:</strong> I implemented a customer feedback loop to track and resolve grievances related to challans. I worked closely with the support team to gather data and introduced automated systems to address common issues while offering better user support.</p>

    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> By addressing 95% of grievances and launching an improved FAQ and support flow, we were able to enhance the overall user experience and increase customer satisfaction by 40%.</p>

    <p><strong>Skills Used:</strong> Customer Support, User Feedback, Issue Resolution, Process Optimization</p>
