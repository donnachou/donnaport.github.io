    <h2>Wireframing and CMS Management – Cars24 Internship Project</h2>

    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Cars24 required a streamlined CMS to better manage content updates and product listings, as well as a robust user interface for product managers.</p>

    <p><strong>Approach:</strong> I worked on wireframing the CMS interface, ensuring it was user-friendly and intuitive. I created wireframes using tools like Figma and collaborated with the development team to integrate them into the CMS.</p>

    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> The new CMS streamlined content management, reducing update times by 30%. The wireframes contributed to an enhanced user interface, leading to smoother workflows and more efficient content updates across the platform.</p>

    <p><strong>Skills Used:</strong> Wireframing, CMS Management, UI/UX Design, Collaboration with Developers</p>
