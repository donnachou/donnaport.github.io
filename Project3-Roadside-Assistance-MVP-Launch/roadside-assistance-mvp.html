    <h2>Roadside Assistance MVP – Cars24 Internship Project</h2>

    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> The Cars24 SuperApp lacked a roadside assistance feature, which is a crucial service for car owners, especially when they're on the road and in need of immediate help.</p>

    <p><strong>Approach:</strong> As part of my internship, I led the design and development of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the Roadside Assistance feature. I worked closely with the product, design, and engineering teams to ensure the feature was user-friendly, easily accessible, and efficient in providing assistance. We prioritized user feedback to ensure the MVP addressed their primary pain points.</p>

    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> The MVP was launched with an impressive 85% user satisfaction during the pilot phase. The feature received positive feedback for its ease of use and effectiveness, and it was later included as a key feature in the Cars24 SuperApp.</p>

    <p><strong>Skills Used:</strong> Product Design, MVP Development, User Feedback Analysis, Cross-functional Collaboration</p>
